 # 30-Days-Of-Python


#### Introduction
 I have decided to participate in  30 days of Python programming challenge by Asabeneh . In this challenge i hope  to learn everything I need to know as a python programmer and the whole concept of programming.

| DAY | TOPICS |
|--------|----------|
| 1      | Introduction |
| 2      | Variables,Built-in Functions |
| 3      |Operators |
| 4      | Introduction |
| 5      | Variables,Built-in Functions |
| 6      |Operators |

###  Day-0ne

## Exercises - Day 1
###         Exercise: Level 1

 
 **Question 1:** Check the python version you are using?<br>

**2** Open the python interactive shell and do the following operations. 
The operands are 3 and 4.
addition(+)
subtraction(-)
multiplication(*)
modulus(%)
division(/)
exponential(**)
floor division operator(//)<br>

 **3:** Write strings on the python interactive shell. The strings are the following:
Your name
Your family name
Your country
I am enjoying 30 days of python<br>
** 4:** Check the data types of the following data:
10
9.8
3.14
4 - 4j
['Asabeneh', 'Python', 'Finland']
Your name
Your family name
Your country<br> 

 ##     Exercise: Level 2
1. Create a folder named day_1 inside 30DaysOfPython folder. Inside day_1 folder, create a python file helloworld.py and repeat questions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Remember to use print() when you are working on a python file. Navigate to the directory where you have saved your file, and run it.


###   Exercise: Level 3
1. Write an example for different Python data types such as Number(Integer, Float, Complex), String, Boolean, List, Tuple, Set and Dictionary.
2. Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) and (10, 8)




The Euclidean distance formula is used to find the length of a line segment 
given two points on a plane. 
This formula says the distance between two points
 (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is d = √[(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2].
 Finding distance helps in proving the given vertices form a square, rectangle, etc (or) proving given vertices form an equilateral triangle, right-angled triangle, etc.
